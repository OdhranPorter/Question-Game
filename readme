1. i had a problem with the game asking the same questions that have already been used, i did solve this using some code i found on a website.
 when it loads one question the quesiton is loaded into a usedquestion array and when the next question is drawn it compares the text in that drawn question
 to the questions inside the array to see if it has been asked before and then at the start of a new game i reset the array.
